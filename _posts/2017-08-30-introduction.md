Introduction

Welcome to VikingsOfNorway!!

This is a new tech/design blog that my fianceÃ© and I have put together so we can write about cool tech/design stuff.  I am a software developer that specializes in Swift and iOS apps (maybe some Javascript too).  My fianceÃ© is the designer, but she also develops iOS and Web apps.  We both love development and design, but need something to keep ourselves learning about new things.  So what's better than a blog where we can help other people learn something.  Here is a short description of the topics I might write about:

- Swift Architecture
- Server Side Swift
- macOS / watchOS / tvOS Apps
- Anything cool

I already have plans for my first blog post that will hopefully be done soon. ðŸ˜¬ It's going to be on Flux architecture in an iOS Swift app.  I am currently on a Javascript project and have been learning about Flux (redux, @ngrx), so I would really like to integrate this design pattern in an iOS Swift app.

==================

I recently graduated with my game design degree ðŸ˜€. This past year I've been I worked with a local dev shop in full stack development. It also became a bit of a design/ UX internship. I recently started using Sketch for wireframing, in addition to Adobe Illustrator. Right now, I am learning Swift development, implementing my wireframes in Xcode. I would like to head into the field of UX/UI Development/Design. Topics I may discuss are:

- Designing a web or mobile application
- Swift Storyboards and constraints
- Web development
- Anything cool
