Eric Downey
==================

Swift Guy
------

I am an experienced iOS developer for the past 7 years, specializing in Swift. Additionally, I am skilled in Javascript, Java, Ruby, and Python for 9 years. As the coordinator for ICC’s Tech Sig and as ICC’s Mobile Practice Lead, I constantly apprise myself on the latest in the information technology field. When clients are stalled in a project, I provide innovative solutions using Swift. As a senior iOS developer and as a certified Scrum Master, I apply Agile methodologies to keep projects running smoothly. 

Grace Tay
==================

UX Gal
------

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Game Design from Southern New Hampshire University. In my senior year, I became a peer tutor in game design, web development, and graphic design. As an intern with a local web development company, I further developed my skills in full-stack development. During my internship, I created designs and wireframes to create a flow for the web pages I later developed. Now, I use Adobe Illustrator and Sketch to develop iOS mockups, later developing them with Swift and Xcode Storyboards.
